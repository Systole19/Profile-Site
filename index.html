    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Pixelsourcery, the design and development service for those with
        big dreams and empty wallets. My name is Darren O'Brien, the lead designer
        and developer at our compact company. I'll be the one sitting down with
        you or skyping with you or something of that nature to determine your needs
        and how we can fulfill them. And we WILL do our utmost to fulfill them. We
        are hardworking and professional little code monkeys.

      <h2>About Pixelsourcery</h2>
      <p>
        Here at Pixelsourcery we strive to give you something you can show to your
        friends, family and clients and not be too embarrased or ashamed. We are
        proud of our average level of skill which we peddle to people at outrageously
        low prices. Really. I'm pretty sure that in some countries it can be classed
        as slavery. Not your one though so you should be fine.
